# Football-Match-Simulation
Here we have two programs. One for the admin users and one for the End users or players. Admin can set the teams for the tournaments and players can simulate the match to play them.
This is a simple football match simulation in which a user can simulate a game between any two teams from the given list of 10 teams. After simulating the game, it will show the goals scored by a team and at what time they are scored and also shows that which team wins in the last. Users have many options to see the whole Leaderboard, See previous matches results, simulate a match, Checking individual team status and reset the whole Leaderboard. 
All of this is done with the help of Linked Lists, structures, Files in C.
